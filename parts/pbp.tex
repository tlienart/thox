\section{Proposal Selection for Particle Belief Propagation}

\todofr{
\begin{itemize}
\item assume BP, LBP, NBP have already been discussed
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Expectation Particle Belief Propagation}

\section{Experiments}

\section{Discussion}

\todofr{
\begin{itemize}
\item watch out to not stress consistency for subquad algo (consistency probably incorrect anyway as per conversation with Naesseth)
\item discuss existing, PBP, NBP etc. explain that NBP probably good for most cases (?) a little bit like KF for HMM.
\end{itemize}
