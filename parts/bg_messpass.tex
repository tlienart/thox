In this chapter, we start with a brief overview of approximate Bayesian inference. We then cover tools  necessary to understand and extend the Expectation Propagation algorithm and the Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm. These methods and variants form the core of this part of the thesis.\check{jul21}

%Before covering the Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm, we need to introduce the exponential family as well as a few key elements from convex analysis which will help understand the EP algorithms and the variants we will discuss in chapter \ref{chap:EPforDBI}.
