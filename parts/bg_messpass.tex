\section{Variational Inference}

\todofr{
    \begin{itemize}\itsep0
    	\item general form (discuss things like alpha divergence, KStein, Wasserstein)
    	\item VB, ELBO, guarantees
    \end{itemize}
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Belief Propagation}

\todofr{
    \begin{itemize}\itsep0
    	\item BP on a tree
		\item LBP when iterating
		\item why is it / is it not a good idea (energy min and MERL stuff)
	\end{itemize}
}

\section{Expectation Propagation}
\todofr{
\begin{itemize}
	\item here add intro to this section, why are we going over exponential family in details, introduce abbreviation EP, ADF
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\todofr{
\begin{itemize}\itsep0
	\item can do expoF but in practice people do Gaussian, why
	\item poor recovery of variance, why
	\item other, non-KL recovery, make link with loss function in general, discuss that
	\item comparison VI and MAP (choice of loss function, popularity etc.)
\end{itemize}
