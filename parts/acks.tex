\section*{Acknowledgments}

I am indebted to both my supervisors Prof.\ Arnaud Doucet and Prof.\ Yee Whye Teh for their patience and their support.
Working with two leading professors in Bayesian computational methods  was sometimes intimidating, often challenging and always inspiring. I am also grateful to the Scatcherd European scholarship fund, EPSRC, the department of Statistics and the Alan Turing Institute for their generous financial support throughout my studies.\\
During my DPhil., I was fortunate to meet, work, and train with amazing people, all of whom played a role in helping me bring this thesis to fruition while staying sane: members of University College, PhD students from the department of Statistics and the Alan Turing Institute, OULRC and UCBC rowers, OUCC cyclists, OUKBC boxers, my colleagues at Cambridge Spark and, more recently, the  Computational Privacy Group at the Imperial College.\\
I am particularly indebted to four of my closest friends: Adrien, Nikola, Armin and Alexander for sharing the pains and excitements of pursuing a DPhil.\ in a mathematical topic and for their unfaltering support.
Many more friends deserve to be mentioned: Petra, Hannah, Julie, Matt, Geoffroy, Francois-Xavier, David, Ali\dots the list goes on and all, in their own way, contributed to this thesis.
\\
Finally, I would like to thank my family and my girlfriend Camille; although the topic of this thesis will likely remain somewhat of a mystery to them, they were always there to listen to my worries, provide encouragements and help me see the light at the end of the tunnel.
