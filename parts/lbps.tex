In this thesis we concern ourselves with sampling or approximating distributions that factorise in a specific way. Here, we cover the Local Bouncy Particle Sampler (LBPS), a version of the BPS introduced at point \ref{point:BPS} for target distributions that factorise according to a MRF.

The aim of this short chapter is to show that the LBPS algorithm can be used on high-dimensional models such as probabilistic matrix factorisation and compare favourably with the HMC algorithm thereby showing the potential of PDMP samplers on complex Machine Learning models.

\section{Local Bouncy Particle Sampler}
In \cite{bouchard15}, the authors consider the case where the target distribution factorises as
%
\eqa{
	\pi(x)&\propto& \prod_{f\in F} \gamma_{f}(x_{f})
}
%
where $x_{f}$ is a restriction to a few elements of $x$ and $F$ is a set of \emph{factors}. In the specific case of a pairwise MRF, the factors are the edges and the restrictions are the variables on each nodes. The energy associated to $\pi$ consequently decomposes as $U\equiv \sum_{f\in F}U_{f}$.

%\subsection{Local BPS: algorithm}
For each factor, a local intensity $\lambda_{f}$ and a local bouncing operator $R_{f}$ can be defined in the same way as for the BPS except that $\nabla U_{f}$ is set to have zero components for all variables not associated to the factor. We can then define a collection of intensities based with
%
\eqa{
	\chi_{f}(t) &=& \lambda_{f}(x^{(i-1)}+v^{(i-1)}t,v^{(i-1)}). 
}
%
The superposition principle can the be considered with $\chi\equiv\sum_{f} \chi_{f}$. Instead of modifying all velocity variables at a bounce as in the basic BPS, the method samples a factor $f$ with probability $\chi_{f}(\tau)/\chi(\tau)$ and modifies only the variables connected to the sampled factor. 
This can significantly reduce the overall computational cost associated with the algorithm and especially so when the underlying MRF has a connection structure that is not too densely connected.\add{come back suggest that if too densely connected then too large a part of the graph would have to be refreshed each time}
