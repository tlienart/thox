# Thesis

(if you happen to be interested, send me an email at `tlienart Â£ turing > ac > uk`)

## Structure

* (cover page with compressed abstract)
* Title page with logo and co
* General Intro
*

## Todo

### Research

* investigate use of LBPS

### Writing

* write more about SNEP + your own way
* skip blah from body and shove it in technical intro
* discuss why only consider marginals (see same discussion in W&J08), discuss alternatives (SMC on GM, Naesseth etc)

### Formatting

* pick notation for messages (with/without arrow), use it throughout. Leaning for without. Requires a comma in HMM setting. Arrows are confusing for pre-message.
* itsep should be the same everywhere
* consistency: lower case *expectation propagation* and *belief propagation*
* caption of algorithms: blue/not
* pass @ end to fix image placement ignore until publish time (add fig on individual pages)
* if only very few propositions/theorems, maybe don't use
* hunt for `(??)` in last pass.
